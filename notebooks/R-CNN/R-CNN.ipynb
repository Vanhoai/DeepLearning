    "#### Implementation of R-CNN architecture using PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) is a pioneering architecture for object detection that combines region proposal networks with CNNs for classification and bounding box regression. It was one of the first methods to achieve high accuracy in object detection tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-CNN architecture consists of several key components:\n",
    "1. Pass the image through selective search and generate region proposals.\n",
    "2. Calculate IOUs (Intersection over Union) on proposed region with ground truth data and add label to the proposed regions.\n",
    "3. Do Transfer Learning using the proposed regions and the labels.\n",
    "4. Pass the image through a classifier to get the final predictions.\n",
    "5. Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove overlapping bounding boxes."

    "##### Selective Search\n",
    "Selective Search is an algorithm used to generate region proposals in R-CNN. It combines the strengths of both exhaustive search and segmentation-based methods to propose regions that are likely to contain objects. The algorithm works by:\n",
    "1. **Over-segmentation**: The image is over-segmented into small regions using a graph-based segmentation algorithm.\n",
    "2. **Merging Regions**: The algorithm merges regions based on color, texture, size, and shape compatibility to form larger regions.\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Merging**: The merging process is hierarchical, allowing the algorithm to generate regions at different scales.\n",
    "4. **Region Proposals**: The final output is a set of region proposals that are likely to contain objects, which are then fed into the CNN for further processing."
